# Money monitoring for generally undesirable websites
The ease of ignorance with respect to time spent on websites is an inherent part of today's attention economy. This project aims to clarify one's perspective on those aspects by quantifying dedicated attention in money, based on one's personal hourly wage, instead of time.

More precisely, this goal should be achieved via a browser plugin. Users
can define what they consider undesirable websites. Time of active tabs
on said websites is then monitored.

Similar, closed-source alternatives exist. This project involves no network communication, i.e. no information is shared with either the developers or a third party.

This plugin is in development and has only been tested for Firefox 57.

# Usage

1. Install the extension.
  - Firefox: Go to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/ and submit the addon. Download the signed xpi file. Go to about:addons and select the xpi file.
  - Chrome: Go to chrome://extensions and load project folder under 'load unpacked extensions'. Make sure to tick the 'Developer Mode' box in the top right-hand corner
2. Navigate to extension options.
  - Adjust hourly wage. E.g. '13'.
  - Add all websites to be considered undesirable, space-separated. E.g. 'www.facebook.com www.reddit.com'.
3. Click to $ sign in the tool bar to check how much money has been spent.
